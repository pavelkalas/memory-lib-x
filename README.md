- **Read and Write Integers:** Enables reading and writing integer values from/to specified memory addresses.

## Usage

### Importing the DLL

To use this library in your project, you need to import the DLL into your C# application. Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet on how to import and use the functions provided by the library:

```csharp
using MemoryLibX;

namespace MemoryTest
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // YOU CAN ALSO GET PID USING PROCESS NAME LIKE BELOW:
            //   Process process = Process.GetProcessByName("process_name")[0];
            //   Memory memory = new Memory(process.Id);

            Memory memory = new Memory(1050 /* PID of the process */);
            memory.BindProcess();

            string str = "Hello, World!";

            memory.WriteStringToMemory(0x0138C15 /* address */, str /* your string */, 16 /* allocation size */);
        }
    }
}

```
